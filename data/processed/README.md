## Project Overview
This project generates personalized course recommendations by analyzing user preferences and course features. It combines content-based filtering, collaborative filtering (KNN, NMF, Neural Network embeddings), and visualizations to suggest relevant courses effectively. The system helps users discover suitable learning paths based on their history, preferences, and similarity with other users.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommendations based on user profile, course genres, and course similarity.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** KNN, NMF, and Neural Network embeddings to predict ratings and generate Top-N recommendations.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision@K, Recall@K, F1@K, RMSE, MAE to measure performance.
- **Visualizations:** Bar charts, heatmaps, and dashboards to interpret recommendation results.
- **Hybrid Insights:** Combines multiple methods for more accurate recommendations.
